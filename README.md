### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Success Ologunsua, a 23 years old not-so-talented writer in a healthy relationship with tech, fashion, fitness, travel and football. 
### I'm also a junior data scientist and content writer based in Lagos, Nigeria. 

I fell in love with data science when I saw how it can be used to improve public health. I'd like to contribute to improved documentation of health statistics, as well as efficient analysis of the records, leading to proper health-policy making.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about machine learning and its applications in the health field

- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with getting a data science intern role

- ðŸ“« How to reach me: Twitter: @TheSussex_ 
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: She/Her
- âš¡ Fun fact: My favourite things to do are stalking people on LinkedIn, looking up unreasonably fast ways to lose weight (10 kg in a week), binge-watching thriller series and obsessing over high-priced hair extensions.
